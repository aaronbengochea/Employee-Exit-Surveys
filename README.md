## Analysis of Employee Exit Surveys - Data Cleaning Exercise
This project focus on cleaning and analysing exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The DETE exit survey can be found hear, meanwhile, the original dataset for the TAFE exit survey is no longer available.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to combine the results for both surveys to answer the following questions:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

The stakeholders want us to combine results from both surveys and answer above questions. Although both surveys used the same template, one of them had customized answers.

## Summary Of Findings
Employees with more years of service tend to have higher likelihoods of resigning due to dissatisfaction in comparison to other employees that have a shorter tenure with the company.
